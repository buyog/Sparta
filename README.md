SPARTA -- A Tiny Blog Engine
---------------------------------------------

Sparta is a pet project project of mine, a minimalist blog/CMS engine written in PHP and MySQL.

There are many like it, [but this one is mine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman's_Creed/ "&ldquo;Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.&rdquo;").

Its primary motivation is twofold:

1. [Get me off a hosted blog platform](http://palagpat-coding.blogspot.com/2010/09/reclaiming-content-manifesto.html), so I own my own content,
2. Give me a sandbox to play with cool new web development features.

Currently, I'm in the middle of a restyling / refactoring of the management panel to be responsive (and less ugly). Then I'll want to do the same to the content templates as well. Then, I'll actually be able to upload it to GitHub, two years since its inception.
